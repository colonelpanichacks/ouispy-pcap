# Wireshark integration

**PCAP capture is served by the on-device dashboard.** Point your browser at
`http://192.168.4.1` after joining the `ouispy-pcap` / `packetsniffer` Wi-Fi,
click **Save PCAP** on the toolbar, and open the downloaded file in Wireshark.

The USB-CDC PCAP streaming path (previously `ouispy_pipe.py` +
`ouispy_extcap.py`) has been removed: ESP32-S3 Arduino USB CDC is not
reliable for high-rate binary streaming, and the dashboard path uses an
immutable PSRAM snapshot which parses cleanly regardless of capture rate.

USB CDC still emits human-readable text summaries (one line per frame) and
responds to `CMD:STATUS` / `CMD:VERSION` for scripting.
